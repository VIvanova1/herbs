# MEAN Stack CRUD App

This is a basic fullstack application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). The app includes reusable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
- Separation of concerns with backend and frontend components.
- Utilizes Angular version 17 with SSR (Server-Side Rendering), Signals, and the new control flow.
- Easy setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/VIvanova1/herbs`
2. Navigate to the backend folder in your terminal: `cd backend`
3. Install backend dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the backend server: `npm run dev`
5. Open another terminal window/tab and navigate to the client/herbs-app folder: `cd client/herbs-app`
6. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
7. Start the frontend server: `ng serve`
8. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view the app.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- Express.js: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- Angular 17: Frontend framework for building dynamic web applications with SSR, Signals, and the new control flow.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.
